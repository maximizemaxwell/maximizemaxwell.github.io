  I am an enthusiastic undergraduate student at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, pursuing a dual major in International Economics and Law & AI-Software with a GPA of 3.55. I have a strong passion for cybersecurity research and innovative solutions in threat detection and secure system design. With hands-on experience in Linux, Python, C, C++, and ongoing studies in Rust, I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to a dynamic security lab environment.
